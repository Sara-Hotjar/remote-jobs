# Hotjar

## Company blurb

Headquartered on the beautiful island of Malta, in the ‘heart’ of the Mediterranean, Hotjar is a young startup that embraces remote working and personal development. Spread throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia, our team casts a wide net across a multitude of locations, lifestyles and backgrounds. It’s our differences that make us interesting, and our shared belief in Hotjar’s core values that bind us together.  

Hotjar's culture is driven by transparency, respect, open discussion, collaboration and blunt and direct feedback. In fact, we're obsessed with communicating with our users as well as within the team. We hate bureaucracy and slow moving organizations – but we're suckers for well-defined processes. We love lean, iterative improvements and success is measure by the value we create for our users. We've written an article in our blog about how we are growing and running Hotjar remotely. 


## Company size

We're at 65 and growing all the time!


## Remote status

Hotjar is a fully remote company, and has been since its inception. Work at Hotjar is suited to those who know they do their best work away from the rigidity of office life. We support and encourage a healthy work / life balance, and in working inline with whatever your version of a productive environment is.

We know that the main challenge of being part of a fully distributed team is getting to know each other in person, so we combat this with bi-annual company retreats. Every summer and winter we bring our team together, to a different location each year, with the aim of achieving 3 things: to get to know each other, to work together sharing ideas and knowledge, and always, to have fun!


## Company technologies

Our back-end is built in Python, our front-end is built in AngularJS and our databases are a mix of PostgreSQL and HBase.

Other tidbits:

## Office locations

We have one physical office in Malta. Nobody regularly works from there. It wouldn't fit us all.  It is always well stocked on snacks though!
